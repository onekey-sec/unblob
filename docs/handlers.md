## LZ4 (legacy)

!!! success "Fully supported"

    === "Description"

        LZ4 legacy format is an older framing format used prior to the LZ4 Frame specification, featuring a simpler structure and no support for skippable frames or extensive metadata. Unlike the default LZ4 Frame format, it lacks built-in checksums, versioning, or block independence flags, making it less robust and primarily used for backward compatibility.
